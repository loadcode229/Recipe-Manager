# About Recipe Manager
Recipe Manager is my Mod 4 Project for Flatiron.
Recipe Manager is a single page application built on Rails(API - backend), JavaScript, HTML, & CSS(frontend).
This app is designed to to be a virtual recipe list. It gives users the ability to view status of recipes(whether it's a liked recipe or not). You can like, reset, and delete chores.
